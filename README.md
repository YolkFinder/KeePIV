# KeePIV
KeePIV is a cutting-edge KeePass plugin designed to enhance the security and usability of your KeePass database using PIV (Personal Identity Verification) technology. KeePIV leverages the power of PIV cards and their cryptographic capabilities to provide a secure and convenient solution for encrypting and decrypting your sensitive data.

Key Features of KeePIV:

1. Seamless PIV Integration:
   KeePIV seamlessly integrates with PIV cards, enabling you to utilize the 9d slot for cryptographic operations. This integration allows for secure key generation, encryption, and decryption directly within KeePass.

2. Choice of Multiple Certificates:
   KeePIV offers the flexibility to add and manage multiple alternative certificates for encrypting and decrypting your database. The plugin ensures that only certificates with the correct Enhanced Key Usage (EKU) and Key Usage (KU) attributes are presented as viable options.

3. Secure Key Generation:
   KeePIV incorporates a robust key generation mechanism, leveraging the PIV card's built-in random number generator (RNG) whenever possible. This ensures the generation of highly secure database keys, providing an additional layer of protection for your KeePass data.

4. NIST-Approved Algorithms:
   KeePIV adheres to industry best practices by supporting NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms. It utilizes advanced algorithms like SHA-256 or above for hashing operations, ensuring the highest level of security for your encrypted database.

5. Customizable Attribute Storage:
